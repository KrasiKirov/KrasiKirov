# Hi, I'm Krasi!👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a third-year software engineering student at McGill University with a focus on full-stack development. I enjoy building web applications, from backend optimization to creating dynamic user interfaces. 

## 💼 Professional Experience
Having completed two internships at Pomerleau, I played a key role in developing and optimizing software solutions that streamlined project management for the company. I initially created a Visual Dashboard app using ASP.NET, improving performance for over 150 project managers and implementing CI/CD pipelines that accelerated delivery by 50%. In my second internship, I designed an Admin platform to manage 200+ projects, optimizing backend services with C# and enhancing frontend usability with JavaScript, resulting in a 25% improvement in response times.
